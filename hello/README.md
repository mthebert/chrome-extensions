# Hello Sample Extension

This extension just pops up a message that says "Hello Extensions" when pressed

## Running this extension

1. Clone this repository.
2. Load this directory in Chrome as an [unpacked extension](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/development-basics/#load-unpacked).
3. Press the new "HI" extension button for your message

## Pin the extension

By default, when you load your extension locally, it will appear in the extensions menu. Pin your extension to the toolbar to quickly access your extension during development.

## Debug The extension

I added a js file that console.logs "This is a popup!" to give me something to debug. Right-click and `inspect` and you can see the output in the console.
